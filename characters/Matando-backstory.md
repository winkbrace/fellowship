# Matando backstory

## Character summary

**Matandrio Siquero** (**Matando** in short) is a Half-darkelf (essentially a half-drow) who was born out of a relationship of violence between Human sorcerer **Gladrim Orunzu** and the very powerful Drow priestess **Quenthel Baenre**. Matando's father was captured by Quenthel who experimented on him with foul magic. One of these experiments involved the sodomization of Gladrim by a Silver dragon, a taint that got carried across to Matando as well. Matando managed to escape Menzoberranzan during the **war of the spider queen** after which he ran into **Mahatmaji** who was just getting out of the Underdark at a convenient time. Being born in an environment of the purest evil, it took all of **Mahatmaji** his cunning to get Matando on the straight path, but never further than neutral.

Matando hates all female Drow, is sickly scared of butterflies, allergic to the smell of eucalyptus and not a fan of Dwarves.

## History

Matando his father Gladrim Orunzu was a young, talented human sorcerer from Neverwinter. He showed real promise in the arts of magic, certainly for his age. In search of adventure he joined a party of other human adventurers who got quite successful in retrieving abducted children and spouses of rich merchants for gold. The party ended up in the Dwarven stronghold of Mithral Hall where they set out in search of the quite unattractive (even for Dwarven standards) third daughter of a rich Dwarven merchant. The reward offered seemed quite high for the task at hand, easily more than thrice of what they were used to get. They were also allowed to pass through the heavy doors guarding the entrance to the Underdark, which was rare to happen, most adventurers where not allowed to pass. 

Blinded by the offer of so much gold and confident as they were, they never stopped to question the specifics. The further the group ventured in the Underdark, the darkness was getting even 'darker', more so than they ever experienced in human territory. While at first there were still sounds from critters and insects, it seemed very silent all of the sudden. 

That was all that he remembered, and then he woke up. In a pitch black cell, bound to the wall with heavy chains and no feeling of his magic powers at all. All he felt was pain. 

He was the only one of the party who was 'spared'. The sense of powerful magic in his body was the reason why Quenthel Baenre took Gladrim as a slave to experiment with as she did see fit. The experiments ranged from simple cuts in the flesh and some casual torture to being sodomized by small dragons and of course the never ending magical tests. He also was forced to satisfy here occasional wicked lust.

Out of this forced relationship a child was born; Matandrio Siquero, a half-darkelf, which usually means a quick death for the infant. Fortunately for him Quenthel sensed powerful magic in Matandrio (Matando in short) and she decided to let him live to continue her experiments on. There was no need for Gladrim anymore, so after a final torture session she used her viper whip to finally kill him off. To make full use of Matando's magical powers he needed to grow up and be trained in the arts of magic, so he was not chained up, but he could not leave the premises either. Of course he was subjected to experiments, torture and he had to do all sorts of boring or rancid tasks.

When Matando came in his teen years his power became so strong that he managed to escape the house. He was still bound to their home city Menzoberranzan however, since there were just too many powerful Priestesses to overcome to be able to leave.

This all changed in the year 1372 DR (War of the spider queen) when Drow goddess Loth felt silent,  no longer affording spells to her priestesses. The powerless females where no match to Matando who could escape out of Menzoberranzan up to the heavy doors leading up to the dwarven stronghold Mithral Hall. Matando tried everything to open the doors, but no matter what spell he tried, the doors would not nudge even the slights bit. When he was preparing his last spell, he heard sounds from behind and saw a slight flickering of light coming from the tunnels behind him. He quickly cast an invisibility spell and moved out of the way. 

A few moments later a group of adventurers came running towards the door. One of the males of the group slammed his heavy hammer loudly on the door resulting in a deafening sound. Moments later the door nudged open and a stout heavily armored Dwarf pushed the door open further. He clearly knew the group and shouted to them to move through the door as quick as they could. Behind them other noises were growing stronger. The sounds of quick limbs of spiders, the slithering of Illithid Lichen and sickening feeling in your mind usually accompanied by the presence of a Mindflayer grew heavier while the door was shutting. 

Matando took his chance and quickly ran though the door, just before it closed.
